Project Overview

You have recently joined the SRE team for an exotic plant reseller startup. They already have a small SRE team in place consisting of two other members. You are just finishing up your training period and are now ready to be on your own. 

You have a busy week ahead of you as there is a release this week plus your on-call shift. Part of your release duties includes helping to maintain the as-built document by adding this new release, as well as planning for system resource changes. For your on-call shift, you have to respond to alerts as they come in and write up an on-call summary to document your shift. Finally, youâ€™ll round out your week by helping to reduce toil. You will have to identify any toil you encounter throughout the week and create a toil reduction plan. After you have a plan all ready, you will need to work on implementing that plan by writing some scripts to help automate tasks.
